  TARGET SCHEMA & DATA TYPES:
  {SPECIFIC_SCHEMA}

  EXTRACTION RULES:
  1. **Precision:** Extract values exactly as they appear in the document. Do not correct spelling unless it's an obvious OCR error (e.g., '0' vs 'O').
  2. **Missing Data:** If a field is not found or is illegible, set its value to null (JSON null). Do NOT invent data.
  3. **Dates:** Standardize all dates to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). If the year is ambiguous, assume the most recent logical year based on context.
  4. **Currency/Numbers:** Extract as pure numbers (floats/integers). Remove symbols like '$', ',' (commas), or space separators. (e.g., "$1,200.50" -> 1200.50).
  5. **Booleans:** Look for checked boxes or explicit statements.
  6. **Confidence Scores:** - Assign a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) for every field based on clarity and visibility.
    - **CRITICAL:** If a field's value is extracted as null, the confidence score MUST be exactly 0.0.
